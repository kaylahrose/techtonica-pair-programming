/*
A palindrome is a word or sentence that’s spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. You should be able to pass strings with varying formats, such as “racecar”, “RaceCar”, and “race CAR” among others such as when the pattern includes special characters. Recall your new syntax: regular expression.

Example 1: 					
Input:	“1 eye for of 1 eye.” 	
Output: False				


Example 2: 
Input: “0_0 (: /-\ :) 0–0”
Output: true
