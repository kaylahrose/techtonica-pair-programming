/*
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Example 1:				    Example 2:					Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]		Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]   Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1				    Output: 4					Output: 1

Notes: Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

Challenge: Can you optimize your implementation to be linear runtime complexity?.
