/*
Halloween is the time of year when youth prepare for tricks or treats! Create a function that accepts a Date object and returns true if it's Halloween (October 31st) and false otherwise. Keep in mind JavaScript's Date month is 0 based, meaning October is the 9th month while January is 0.

Examples:
timeForTrickOrTreat(new Date(2013, 9, 31)) ➞ true
timeForTrickorTreat(new Date(2013, 0, 23)) ➞ false
timeForTrickorTreat(new Date(3000, 9, 31)) ➞ true
