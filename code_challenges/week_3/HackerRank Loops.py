# The HackerRank challenge titled "Loops" focuses on understanding loops in Python, specifically for, while, and do...while loops. Each type of loop has its own syntax and use cases, and mastering them is essential for writing efficient and readable code. Below, I'll provide solutions for problems typically encountered in such challenges, including examples of each loop type.

# Problem 1: Print Numbers from 1 to N 
# Task: Print numbers from 1 to N using a for loop.

# 
# Problem 2: Print Even Numbers from N to 1 
# Task: Print even numbers from N to 1 using a while loop.

# Problem 3: Count Down and Up with Jump 
# Task: Count down from N to 1 with a jump of J, and count up from 1 to N with a jump of J using do...while loops.

# Note: Python doesn't have exact equivalents to JavaScript's do...while loop, but you can achieve similar functionality using a while loop with an initial condition check.
