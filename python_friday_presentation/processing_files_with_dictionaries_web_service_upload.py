# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to create a Python script that processes text files, converts their contents into dictionaries, and uploads the data to a running web service. Follow these steps:

# Set up your environment:
    # Install Python if you haven't already
    # Install the necessary libraries (requests for HTTP requests)

# Create a Python script that does the following:
    # a. Reads all .txt files from a specified directory (e.g., /data/feedback)
    # b. Processes each file to extract relevant information (e.g., title, name, date, feedback)
    # c. Creates a dictionary for each file, with the extracted information as key-value pairs
    # d. Uses the requests library to send a POST request to a web service endpoint
    # e. Uploads the dictionary data to the web service

    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

        # import os
        # import requests

        # def process_file(file_path):
        #     # Process the file content and return a dictionary
        #     pass

        # def upload_to_web_service(data):
        #     # Send POST request to the web service
        #     pass

        # # Main execution
        # feedback_dir = '/data/feedback'
        # files = os.listdir(feedback_dir)

        # for file in files:
        #     file_path = os.path.join(feedback_dir, file)
        #     feedback_dict = process_file(file_path)
            
        #     if feedback_dict:
        #         upload_to_web_service(feedback_dict)
        #         print(f"Uploaded feedback from {file}")
        #     else:
        #         print(f"Failed to process {file}")

        # print("Processing complete.")
# Implement the process_file function to read the content of each text file and create a dictionary with the extracted information.
# Implement the upload_to_web_service function using the requests library to send POST requests to your web service endpoint.
# Handle potential errors during file processing and web service upload.
# Test your script thoroughly with sample data.

# Key Points to Consider:
    # Understand how to read and write files in Python
    # Learn how to use dictionaries effectively
    # Understand HTTP POST requests and how to format data for sending
    # Practice error handling techniques


# =====================
# EVALUATION CRITERIA
# =====================

# I. Environment Setup
    # Correct installation of Python and necessary libraries (requests)
    # Proper setup of project directory structure

# II. File Processing
    # Correct use of os.listdir() to read all .txt files from /data/feedback
    # Accurate extraction of relevant information (title, name, date, feedback) from each file
    # Creation of dictionaries with extracted information as key-value pairs

# III. Web Service Interaction
    # Correct implementation of requests library for HTTP POST requests
    # Proper formatting of dictionary data for sending via POST request
    # Successful connection to the web service endpoint

# IV. Error Handling
    # Appropriate error handling during file processing
    # Proper error handling for web service upload attempts

# V. Code Organization and Readability
    # Clear and logical structure of the script
    # Proper use of functions for different tasks
    # Well-commented code explaining key steps

# VI. Testing and Verification
    # Thorough testing of the script with sample data
    # Verification of successful uploads through web interface or logs

# VII. Additional Considerations
    # Handling of potential edge cases (e.g., empty files, malformed data)
    # Efficiency in processing large numbers of files
