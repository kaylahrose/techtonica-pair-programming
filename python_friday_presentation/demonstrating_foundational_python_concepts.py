# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to create a Python script that demonstrates several key foundational concepts. Follow these steps:

# Create a Python script that incorporates the following elements:
    # a. Variables and Data Types
        # Declare variables of different data types (int, float, string, boolean)
        # Demonstrate type conversion between numeric types

    # b. Control Flow Statements
        # Use if-else statements to control program flow
        # Implement nested if-else conditions

    # c. Loops
        # Use a for loop to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list of numbers)
        # Use a while loop to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met

   # d. Functions
        # Define and call a simple function
        # Pass arguments to the function
    
    # e. Lists and Tuples
        # Create and manipulate lists and tuples
        # Perform common operations like indexing, slicing, and concatenation
   
    # f. Strings
        # Manipulate strings using various methods (e.g., upper(), lower(), strip())
        # Format strings using f-strings or the .format() method
        # Include comments throughout your code to explain each concept as you implement it.
        # Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose.
        # Organize your code into logical sections using blank lines for readability.
        # Include error handling for potential exceptions (e.g., using try-except blocks).

    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

            # Variable declarations and data types
            # integer_var = 42
            # float_var = 3.14
            # string_var = "Hello, World!"
            # boolean_var = True

            # Type conversion
            # converted_int = int(float_var)

            # Control flow
            # if boolean_var:
            #     print("Boolean is True")
            # else:
            #     print("Boolean is False")

            # Nested conditions
            # if integer_var > 10:
            #     print("Integer is greater than 10")
            #     if integer_var > 50:
            #         print("Integer is also greater than 50")
            #     else:
            #         print("Integer is between 11 and 50")

            # Loops
            # for i in range(5):
            #     print(f"Iteration {i}")

            # While loop
            # number = 0
            # while number < 5:
            #     print(number)
            #     number += 1

            # Function definition and call
            # def greet(name):
            #     return f"Hello, {name}!"

            # result = greet("Alice")
            # print(result)

            # Lists and tuples
            # my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            # my_tuple = (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

            # String manipulation
            # original_string = "   Hello, World!   "
            # cleaned_string = original_string.strip().upper()
            # formatted_string = f"My favorite string is '{cleaned_string}'."

            # print(formatted_string)
