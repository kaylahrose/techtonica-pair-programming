# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to demonstrate your ability to generate Python scripts using AI assistance. Follow these steps:

    # Choose a simple application idea, such as a basic calculator or a simple game like "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
    # Use an AI coding assistant tool (like GitHub Copilot, Kite, or Codota) to help you write the initial structure of your script.
    # Implement the following features in your script:
        # A main function that serves as the entry point
        # At least two other functions related to your chosen application (e.g., addition/subtraction functions for a calculator)
        # A loop that allows users to interact with your program multiple times
    # Write clear comments explaining each function and key parts of your code.
    # Include error handling to deal with potential input errors or unexpected situations.
    # Use proper indentation and follow Python style guidelines.
    # Test your script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
    
    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

            # def main():
            #     # Main function to run the program
            #     pass

            # def add_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to add two numbers
            #     pass

            # def subtract_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to subtract two numbers
            #     pass

            # # Main execution
            # if __name__ == "__main__":
            #     main()

    # Run your script and observe its output.

# Key Points to Consider:
    # Understand how AI coding assistants work and their limitations
    # Learn to write clear, descriptive comments
    # Practice error handling techniques
    # Understand the structure of Python programs, including functions and main execution block



# =====================
# EVALUATION CRITERIA
# =====================

# I. Application Concept
    # Demonstrates a clear and well-thought-out application idea (e.g., a functional calculator or a simple game)
    # Shows some effort in choosing an application idea, but it may be too complex or vague
    # Fails to provide a clear application idea
    # Creativity in application idea
    # Effort demonstrated in learning about AI coding assistants

# II. Code Structure and Organization
    # Implements all required components clearly and correctly
        # Includes a main function
        # Defines at least two additional functions related to the application
        # Incorporates a loop for user interaction
    # Mostly implements the required components, but may miss one or two
    # Fails to implement key structural elements

# III. Functionality and Implementation
    # Correctly implements all required functions and logic
    # Shows good effort in implementation, but may have minor bugs or incomplete functionality
    # Demonstrates partial implementation, but lacks critical functionality
    # Fails to implement any significant functionality

# IV. Comments and Documentation
    # Provides clear, descriptive comments explaining each function and key parts of the code
    # Offers some comments, but they may be unclear or insufficient
    # Lacks adequate comments or documentation

# V. Error Handling
    # Implements basic error handling for potential input errors or unexpected situations
    # Shows some effort in error handling, but it may be incomplete or ineffective
    # Fails to implement any significant error handling

# VI. Code Style and Formatting
    # Adheres to Python style guidelines and uses proper indentation
    # Shows good effort in following style guidelines, but may have minor issues
    # Lacks adherence to style guidelines or has significant formatting issues

# VII. Testing and Output
    # Runs the script successfully and produces expected output
    # Shows some effort in testing, but may have bugs or unexpected behavior
    # Fails to run or produce meaningful output
