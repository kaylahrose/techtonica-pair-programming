/*

You have two arrays. One shows the names of the people names, while the other shows their occupation jobs. Your task is to create an object displaying each person to their respective occupation. The two arrays have the same length. The index of a name in the names array is the same as the index of the person's job in the jobs array, as shown in the table above.

Names:	Annie		Steven		Lisa		Osman
Jobs:		Teacher	Engineer	Doctor	Cashier

Example
const names = ["Dennis", "Vera", "Mabel", "Annette", "Sussan"]
const jobs = ["Butcher", "Programmer", "Doctor", "Teacher", "Lecturer"]

assignPersonToJob(names, jobs) âžž {
  Dennis: "Butcher",
  Vera: "Programmer",
  Mabel: "Doctor",
  Annette: "Teacher",
  Sussan: "Lecturer"
}
