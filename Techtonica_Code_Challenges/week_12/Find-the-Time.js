/*
The time has a format: hours:minutes. Both given hours and minutes will always have two digits, like 09:00.

Make a regex to find time in the string: Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456. In this task thereâ€™s no need to check time correctness yet, so 25:99 can also be a valid result. The regex should not match 123:456. Take your time with this problem. You will be learning how to use a new syntax: regular expression.

Example 1							            
Input: I will have lunch at 12:00pm today at 925 Restaurant.		
Output: 12:00	

Example 2
Input: Their daughter was born at 03:00am at 55 Melbourne Dr
Output: 03:00
