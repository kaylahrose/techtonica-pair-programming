### NOTE: It is not necessary to memorise SQL queries, most developers look up these commands, and the more you use them, the more familiar they will become to you.

You have been given a starter tables in `employee.sql` and `department.sql`. Use the subsequent query files to complete your exercise.

#### Considerations
- In your table setup, `DEPT_ID` in the `employee` table is a foreign key that references `DEPT_ID` in the `department` table, establishing a relationship between the two tables

#### Query1 Prompt: JOIN QUERY ON BOTH TABLES
- To query data across multiple tables, you can use the JOIN clause 

#### Query2 Prompt: EMAILS WITH SALARY >= $70,000
- Fnd all employee emails in the employee and department tables where the salary is 70000 or more, you can use a SQL query that involves a JOIN operation between the two tables

#### Query3 Prompt: INCLUDE DEPARTMENT NAME

#### Query4 Prompt: SORT BY DEPARTMENT NAME
