The goal of this mini webpage is to get used to creating sections and using basic HTML and CSS and practice DOM Manipulation

Make 3 or 4 `<div>`s (as many as are in your group). Put one of your names in an `<h2>` in each `<div>`

Add a paragraph within each div with your names in it. add "I live in city" using the `<strong>` tag to make the city bold

Make an unordered list with each of your names

In the list, add a [ tag with the link to your favorite restaurant. Make sure the text of the link says the restuarnt name--!]
