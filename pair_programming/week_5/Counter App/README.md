# Counter App

### Your Tasks
1. Create a component Counter that shows a counter starting at 0
2. The component should have 3 buttons, one to increment the counter, another one for decrement the counter, and the third one to reset the counter to 0
3. Manage each one of the buttons with functions that react to a user click. Hint: you do that with an onClick() method.
4. You will need to use a state for managing this counter. These are the steps:
5. Import useState from react on the top of your file.
6. Create your state inside your component.
display your state (hint: your counter) inside the component
7. Change the state (hint: using setState) inside your functions that are being called in the onClicks methods

Bonus:
1. Style the component using the .css file
