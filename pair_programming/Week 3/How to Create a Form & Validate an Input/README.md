### Create a form and validate its inputs with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 

1. Set up the form structure in HTML with input fields for the `username`, `email`, and `password`. Each input field should have a corresponding label and two of the fields should include a `required` attribute to enforce mandatory fields.

2. Apply styles with CSS to make it visually appealing and to highlight invalid inputs. Add classes to handle errors and apply styles.

3. Add validation logic with JavaScript to handle client-side validation when the form is submitted. This script should check the input values against whether the email is in a valid format and the password meets length requirements.
